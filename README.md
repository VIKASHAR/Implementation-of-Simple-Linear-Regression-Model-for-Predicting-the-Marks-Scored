# Implementation-of-Simple-Linear-Regression-Model-for-Predicting-the-Marks-Scored

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the marks scored by a student using the simple linear regression model.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm

1.import the needed packages.

2. Assigning hours to x and scores to y.
   
3. Plot the scatter plot.
 
4. Use mse,rmse,mae formula to find the values.

## Program:
```
